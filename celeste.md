# Celeste Tas and Speedruns:

Video game inputs are based off of framerates. Celeste runs at 60 FPS. That means game is checking what button is pressed every 1/60th of a second. For the TAS I've gone through frame-by-frame and provided the inputs. I don't have a very good demo yet, but the video that gives the best idea of what's going on is Lvl 6 Reflection TAS because it has the TAS tools running next to the game.

Lvl 7 Summit TAS:
To come, it's partially done. It takes about 3 hours to do 45 seconds of TAS inputs and this one will be 8 minutes so at minimum 30 hours, more realistically 40-50 hours.
