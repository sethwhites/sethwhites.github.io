# Celeste Tas and Speedruns:

Here are some demos for the TAS. I don't have a very good demo yet, but the video that gives the best idea of what's going on is Lvl 6 Reflection TAS because it has the TAS tools running next to the game.

Lvl 7 Summit TAS:

To come, it's partially done. It takes about 3 hours to do 45 seconds of TAS inputs and this one will be 8 minutes so at minimum 30 hours, more realistically 40-50 hours.

Other Input frame Data:
- Coyote Timer
  - You have 5 frames to jump after leaving a platform. The name of the trick is a reference to Wile E. Coyote. This trick is best shown in Ridge TAS at 2m13s.
- Fast fall
  - The maximum fall speed is 160. It can be increased by holding down, to a maximum of 240.
- Random dashing while waiting for a door or something else.
  - When dashing the game and timer freezes for 5 frames.
- Here is a [website](http://tasvideos.org/GameResources/Windows/Celeste.html) with more frame data if you're interested.
