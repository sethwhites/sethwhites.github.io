[Creation 101 Projects](creation101.md)  
This is a class I took Senior Year that teaches how to use a laser cutter, 3-D printer, making molds/casts, and input/output devices. It also taught me about the importance of personal projects and how fun they can be!

[Celeste TAS](celeste.md)  
Celeste is a video game. Video game inputs are based off of framerates. Celeste runs at 60 FPS. That means game is checking what button is pressed every 1/60th of a second. For the TAS Iâ€™ve gone through frame-by-frame and provided the inputs. Celeste is an extremely difficult platformer that has great art, music, and gameplay. You play as Madeline and are trying to climb a literal and figurative mountain. You can walk, jump, climb, and dash. I speedrun the game, so you'll see a more extreme version of it. Some of them is me playing and some are of the computer playing. For the TAS I programmed my computer to execute the inputs frame-by-frame in-game the same way I would, except without messing up!

[Solenoid Driver](AutomationSubsystem.pdf)  
I made a solenoid driver in my Capstone Project. I knew next to nothing about how to do this before starting.
I made this artifact, or document, so that anyone else trying to manufacture this device could.
